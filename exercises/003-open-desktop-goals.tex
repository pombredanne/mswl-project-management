\section{Questions}

\emph{What is the purpose and main goals of the \emph{openDesktop}\footnote{\url{http://opendesktop.org/}} community? Do you think it makes sense to join efforts in the development of open desktop environments? Provide at least 2 reasons to support your answer.}

\par \emph{OpenDesktop} is a social network FLOSS community. Is focused in \emph{user generated contents} such applications, artwork, documents and other files. Being a community social network gives the opportunity to connect FLOSS users and producers, through the tools available to: creating groups, microblogging, messaging\ldots Uses the umbrella term for its description because it encompasses all types of free content on a social network, where users and producers interact to the main goal, Open Desktop environments.

\par OpenDesktop gives to FLOSS community a place to interact between users and producers increase the communication and the improvement about their projects, the more users interact better the result.

\par \emph{Joining efforts in development of desktop environments}. why ?

\par the main reason is, that by joining forces and knowledge will reach a common goal, the Open Desktop environment\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDesktop.org\#History}}. As we see in the history of this portal, KDE and GNOME joined forces, sometimes conflicting, to achieve their common goal the OpenDesktop. As we can see in other examples as the Open Handset Alliance\footnote{\url{http://www.openhandsetalliance.com}}, where, telephone companies, software developers, handset manufactures, companies and semicondur commercialization companies, joined forces and managed to establish a common and free niche for mobile: Android\footnote{\url{http://developer.android.com/sdk/}}.

\par The last but not the least reason, is that the more knowledge and interaction is concentrated, ie when exists a more participatory society, the goals evolving best. This statement is not new, has been used for centuries. Comes to explain life as a citizen in society since the time of Socrates.

\par Joining efforts increases the knowledge and easily reaches goals, becoming a better community around FLOSS, around everything.
