\section{SME Introduction}
\label{sec:sme-introduction}

\par \emph{Code Garden} is our SME. We develop software products using quality patterns. Quality patterns are our main goal, applying Quality patterns to software development as is. plants and the code can not be kept alone, they can grow with life, diverted, or wither in a forgotten place. So plants like the code, need extra care, some gardeners, so they can grow and flourish. 

\par \emph{Technical Debt} is not a monster chasing us in every development sprint is another \emph{ROL} that we accept and we have interaction with it. We need him and he needs us.

\par Thus, we created a software product that helps us to deal with Technical Debt, \textbf{Greenhouse}.

\par \emph{Greenhouse} is our tool to track the progress of the evolution of code quality within a controlled environment. Using quality metrics for each programming language helps us reduce technical debt faster

\section{Publish the project}
\label{sec:publish-project}

\par We want to publish \emph{Greenhouse} as a FLOSS\footnote{Free Libre Open Source Software} project with two Software Licenses.

\par One a FLOSS License and the other a Private License. We chose a \emph{Dual-License} product.

\par Thus we can serve every type of costumers as MySQL business model explained by Elena Blanco\cite{dl-business-model}.

\begin{quotation}
    \emph{For anyone who wants to develop and distribute but does not want to release the source code for their application, MySQL is able to provide a commercial licence. Because MySQL has full ownership of the MySQL code, it is able to tailor its commercial licensing terms to meet the unique requirements of users interested in embedding or bundling MySQL.}
\end{quotation}

\subsection{Dual License}
\label{sub:dual-license}

\par Free Software License and Private, Brief discussion about licenses (your company has heard about some BSD or GPL, but they are not sure!).

\par FLOSS License selected to publish \emph{Greenhouse} is \emph{GPLv3}\footnote{GNU Public License Version 3 - \url{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html}}. This FLOSS License provides all freedoms to the project:

\begin{itemize}
	\item the freedom to use the software for any purpose,
	\item the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,
	\item the freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors, and
	\item the freedom to share the changes you make.
\end{itemize}

\par The other License is a private License. A private License gives us more flexibility through market niche.

\par Good thing to take in advance using a Private License are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Avoid possible or unexpected License Violations.
	\item Build a project in your company and be 100\% sure that you are not violation any License under your product.
	\item This License envelops the whole product into a private version.
\end{itemize}

\par This private License gives you the opportunity to deal with \emph{Greenhouse} libraries and include into other projects using full capabilities. This way you can avoid License problems with derivated works and be compatible with other FLOSS Licenses.

\par Brian Behlendorf\cite{brian-behlendorf-business-strategy} explains this model with a success and its weaknesses with the community development:

\begin{quotation}
    \emph{You have to be very careful, though, to make sure that any code volunteered to you by third parties is explicitly available for this non-free branch; you ensure this by either declaring that only you (or people employed by you) will write code for this project, or that (in addition) you'll get explicit clearance from each contributor to take whatever they contribute into a non-free version.}
\end{quotation}

\par We are very concerned about how to interact with the community. Our goal is provide to community the opportunity to develop solutions to our clients for \emph{Greenhouse}.

\begin{quotation}
    \emph{I would claim that if you treat your contributors right, perhaps even offer them money or other compensation for their contributions (it is, after all, helping your commercial bottom line), this model could work.}
\end{quotation}

\par Last quotation is how \emph{Transvirtual}\footnote{\url{http://www.transvirtualsystems.com/}} in Berkeley applied this model to a commercial lightweight Java. Encourage the developers to work and earn money directly with the software they make. We believe in this model to create a community involved around the product: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item The usability of the product.
	\item Tangible incentives as our case the money.
\end{itemize}

\par In this way we will try to solve the dilemma of FLOSS developments that can be converted into proprietary solutions.

\par Therefor, an exchange of knowledge by salaries to the community through an assignment of copyright to Code Garden by using the \emph{GPLv3 License}, they maintain the authoring and earn tangible rewards too.

\par We are the copyright holders of \emph{Greenhouse} and thus , we want to share the maintenability with community knowledge to provide solutions for companies with private Licenses of the product.

\par We want to evolve with the community and spread our developments and remain FLOSS.

\section{Market niche - Competitors analysis}
\label{sec:market-niche}

\par Code analysis is increasing everyday in software development. SME \& Big Enterprises focus its products near quality. Why ? Because Software Development is measurable, high measurable I could say. Every software is developed guided by patterns through developers and the final product (talking about clients) is released to the client showing its functionality but what happens with all the code developed inside ?

\par The code evolves as the development grows. In a development team is difficult to measure the quality of the product grained.

\par Other sample of the use of measure the quality is when you have to choose between two libraries to implement another service that use the functionality implemented by them. One metric to take care is the code quality that you can apply for them. Using some objective metrics you can retrieve a numeric result that gives you a general idea. Or if you want to add an existing module/library you can choose the one which its result is near to your software, not lesser not higher. It is a way of seeking for a balance in development and knowledge about complexity of a module to import to your product.

\par There are some samples of Analyzing tools but we are to analyze \emph{Code Climate} and \emph{Sonar}.

\subsection{Code climate}
\label{sub:code-climate}

\textbf{Code climate} - \url{https://codeclimate.com/}. Code quality analysis in Ruby Language. But we will not focus on language but with what gives us the tool.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{code-climate.png}
\caption{Code Climate Notifications}
\label{}
\end{figure}

\par This tool gives us interoperability with Software Forges like Github integration. Source Code Management with Git repositories, Code Quality evolution, Notifications, Comparison tools. This tool set is simple but efficient, this is very important. Play with the ease of integration into a forge development offering hosting server, pay and enjoy the product (one click purchase).

\par Includes the main features of services; \emph{PaaS}\footnote{Platform as a Service}, \emph{IaaS}\footnote{Infrastructure as a Service} and \emph{SaaS}\footnote{Software as a Service}. Using \emph{bluebox services} - \url{https://bluebox.net/}: Virtualized Environments on Actual Hardware.

\par We want those services available for every developer and easily result visualization.

\par It's free (gratis) to use for FLOSS projects.

% subsection code-climate (end)

\subsection{Sonar}
\label{sub:sonar}

\textbf{Sonar} - \url{http://www.sonarsource.org/}. Sonar slogan is very clear:

\begin{quote}
    \emph{Put your technical debt under control}
\end{quote}

\par Despite Code Climate, Sonar covers lots of languages and is a FLOSS product. A very good point to consider for the use of this software. Controls and test every corner of your project.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{sonar7axes.png}
\caption{Sonar covers 7 axes}
\label{sonar7axes}
\end{figure}

\par This Software gives you the opportunity to integrate with your Source code management and a result metrics result visualization panel with Nemo - \url{http://nemo.sonarsource.org/} using Saas solution through \emph{Cloud Bees} - \url{http://www.cloudbees.com/platform-service-sonarsource.cb}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{nemo-evolution.png}

\label{}
\end{figure}

\par Sonar is focused in code Analysis its market niche as Code Climate but offering easy configurable solutions for integrate your projects with giving you the possibility to analyze our software and visualize the results among time.

\par This is our niche, Software Analysis, visualization and interoperability between Source Code Management.

\subsection{Where will be published the code ?}
\label{sub:publish-code}

\par First is not where, first is, which SVC - \emph{System Version Control} - will be used ?

\par We choose a DVC - \emph{Distributed Version Control} - System instead of an CVC\emph{Centralized Version Control} System. A \emph{DVC} increases the capabilities to developers (including community contributors) to develop solutions and test their development in every environment. The main reason is that a \emph{DVC} gives you the opportunity to work without being connected to internet and save all your historical revisions. The other reason is that applying \emph{DVC} Systems (mainstream) workflow Branch per Feature from Martin Fowler analysis\cite{branch-per-feature} and how to fit with Continuous Integration Development, increases the productivity and facilitates the integration of new developments minimizing the problems with merging in \emph{CVC}s. Thinking about publishing a project as FLOSS with the idea of creating a solid and integrate community we must use a \emph{DVC}.

\par The are different \emph{DVC}s to choose:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Monotone - \url{http://www.monotone.ca/}. monotone is a free distributed version control system. It provides a simple, single-file transactional version store, with fully disconnected operation and an efficient peer-to-peer synchronization protocol. \emph{Introduced hash commits}.
	\item GNU Arch - \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/}. It is used to keep track of the changes made to a source tree and to help programmers combine and otherwise manipulate changes made by multiple people or at different times.
	\item Bazaar - \url{http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/}. Bazaar is a version control system that helps you track project history over time and to collaborate easily with others. \emph{GNU Arch fork}.
	\item Darcs - \url{http://darcs.net/}. Darcs is a free and open source, cross-platform version control system, like git, mercurial or subversion but with a very different approach. Thanks to its focus on changes rather than snapshots, Darcs can offer a freer way of working, and a simpler user interface. It's written in \emph{haskell}.
	\item Git - \url{http://git-scm.com/}. Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
	\item Mercurial - \url{http://mercurial.selenic.com/}. Mercurial is a free, distributed source control management tool. It efficiently handles projects of any size and offers an easy and intuitive. 
\end{itemize}

\par After a deep analysis for choose one \emph{DVCs}. We decided to use Git. Our decision is based in the facility to propagate through internet, most development forges allow and promote the use of Git instead of others, this could be a hype but a hype that works because if this system has not a good \emph{interoperability} APIs and easy hooks configurations will be replaced easily. And was born from Linus Torvalds after BitKeeper affair with taxes and its 'special' license clause\footnote{\url{http://kerneltrap.org/node/444}} to manage Linux kernel source.

\par After choosing Git we must decide where. We decided to host our Git Repository in Github - \url{https://github.com/} - Projects and community in Github have a lot of visibility and i uses a clean user-friendly interface furthermore is a Git powered forge that allows an easy implementation of hooks to our repositories. Why is this important to us ? Because our project is a code analyzer where could be better hosted to be tested than in an easily interoperability configurable forge that spread hook integration. I think this forge increases the visualization to your work, organization capabilities and community communication, the most important issue.
