\section{SME Introduction}
\label{sec:sme-introduction}

\par \emph{Code Garden} is our SME. We develop software products using quality patterns. Quality patterns are our main goal, applying Quality patterns to software development as is. plants and the code can not be kept alone, they can grow with life, diverted, or wither in a forgotten place. So plants like the code, need extra care, some gardeners, so they can grow and flourish. 

\par \emph{Technical Debt} is not a monster chasing us in every development sprint is another \emph{ROL} that we accept and we have interaction with it. We need him and he needs us.

\par Thus, we created a software product that helps us to deal with Technical Debt, \textbf{Greenhouse}.

\par \emph{Greenhouse} is our tool to track the progress of the evolution of code quality within a controlled environment. Using quality metrics for each programming language helps us reduce technical debt faster
